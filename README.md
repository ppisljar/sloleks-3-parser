# Morphological lexicon Sloleks 3.0 parser

## What does this parser do?
This parser will extract all data from the the 13 GB of XML [found here](https://www.clarin.si/repository/xmlui/handle/11356/1745)
and put it in a 1GB SQLite database so that it can be used for further processing.

apart from converting to sql it also does the following:
- removes diplicate prouciations, accentuations, forms and lemmas
- some lexical units had dupliate IDS (for diferent words), which were updated to be unique
- some word forms had multiple orthography forms, which were split out into separate word_forms to enable correct linking to accentuation and pronunciation
- [] add MSD to lexical unit

## TODO:
- [] add comment, relatedEntryList and labelList to lexical unit
- [] more fields to word forms
- [] add script to generate missing accentuations and pronunciations

## How did you extract the XML data?
Like this:
```bash
# activate a Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv env && source env/bin/activate
# install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# download the data
./get_data.sh
# run the parser
python convert.py
```

After about 1 hour the data will get transferred to a 1 GB SQLite database called `sloleks.db`.

dump was then generated with
```
sqlite3 sample.db .dump > dump.sql.
```

## pubished SQL database

you can find exported sqlite file here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ppisljar/sloleks-3-sql/blob/main/sloleks.db
and the sql dump file which can be used to import the database to other SQLs (mysql, postgre, ...) is here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ppisljar/sloleks-3-sql/blob/main/sloleks.dump.sql
